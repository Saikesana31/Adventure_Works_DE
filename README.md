# üè¢AdventureWorks Data Engineering Pipeline (ADF + Power BI)

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution** using **Azure Data Factory**, **SQL-based transformations**, and **Power BI reporting**. The goal is to provide insights into AdventureWorks sales, products, and customer performance using modern data processing techniques and applied **Azure cloud service** to create a modern data lakehouse architecture.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture](./Images/Architecture.png)
I followed the **medallion architecture** pattern (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for organizing data at different processing stages.

#### Medallion Architecture
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from GitHub repository via Azure Data Factory
- **Silver Layer**: Transformed and cleaned data stored as Parquet files in Azure Data Lake Storage
- **Gold Layer**: Optimized analytics-ready data exposed through views and external tables in Azure Synapse Analytics

---

## Dataset
**AdventureWorks dataset containing**:
- Product Categories and Subcategories
- Products
- Customers
- Calendar (Date dimension)
- Sales (2015-2017)
- Returns
- Territories

**Step-1:** `Bronze Layer`
---
In **Azure Data Factory Pipelines**, I created a Dynamic Pipeline that:
- uses a **`Lookup activity`** to read configuration from `git.json`(parameters)  
Here The output from the above activity is connected to foreach loop
- applied **`ForEach`** loops to dynamically process multiple CSV files   
and Then inside the foreach activity u apply **`copydata`** Activity
- Using **`copydata`** copies data from GitHub to the **Bronze layer** in Azure Data Lake Storage

**Step-2:** `silver Layer`
---
- Intermediate transformations handled via **Databricks** notebooks `Transformation_silver.dbc`.
- Cleansing, normalization, and type handling are performed.
- After performing all transformation the data is pushed into silver layer in Azure Data Lake Storage using pyspark `df.write`

---

**Step-3:** `Gold Layer`
---
In **Azure synapse Analytics**,I created SQL scripts like :
- `create schema.sql`, `External Table.sql`, and `create views gold.sql` build optimized star schema views for reporting.
Here,
    - `create views gold.sql` uses the **OPENROWSET** function to acess the 














## üîß Tools & Technologies
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Data orchestration and ingestion from dynamic GitHub sources.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Bronze layer for raw data.
- **SQL Scripts**: Schema creation, gold layer transformations, and view generation.
- **Power BI**: Visual storytelling and dashboards.
- **GitHub**: Source for dynamic CSV datasets.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw Data Ingestion
- Utilizes **dynamic pipelines in ADF** (`Dynamic_data_Bronze.json`) to pull data from GitHub links.
- **`git.json`** stores metadata with URLs, output file names, and sink paths.
- `ForEach` activity dynamically loops through the URLs and copies CSVs to Blob Storage using HTTP sources and sinks.

### 2. Silver Layer ‚Äì Data Transformation
- Intermediate transformations handled via Databricks notebooks (`Transformation_silver.dbc` - not fully explored here).
- Cleansing, normalization, and type handling are performed.

### 3. Gold Layer ‚Äì Schema & Views
- SQL scripts `create schema.sql`, `External Table.sql`, and `create views gold.sql` build optimized star schema views for reporting.
- Data is logically structured into **fact** and **dimension** tables.

### 4. Visualization ‚Äì Power BI
- `AdventureWorks_PowerBI_reporting.pbix` includes:
  - Sales trends and territory-wise revenue
  - Customer segmentation
  - Product performance
  - Returns and profitability dashboards

## üìÇ How to Use

1. Update your GitHub raw URLs in `git.json`
2. Upload pipeline JSON into Azure Data Factory
3. Run pipeline to populate data into Bronze layer
4. Use SQL scripts to build schema and views
5. Open Power BI file and update data source paths
6. Publish Power BI dashboard for stakeholders
